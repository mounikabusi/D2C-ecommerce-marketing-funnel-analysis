Window Functions: SUM() OVER(), RANK() OVER() for revenue contribution and campaign ranking
Running Totals: Cumulative monthly revenue using SUM() OVER (ORDER BY month)
CTEs and multi-level aggregations
Group-by aggregations across channels, devices, regions, and user types
Conversion rate, cart abandonment rate, and checkout completion rate calculations



## 📈 SQL Analysis Sections


Exploratory Data Analysis — row counts, schema inspection
Funnel Analysis — stage-wise drop-off across the customer journey
Channel Analysis — revenue, conversion rate, and purchase share by channel
Revenue Segmentation — by region, device, user type, and campaign type

## 💡 Business Recommendations


Reduce cart abandonment (68.82%) by triggering email/SMS reminders after cart add — especially for mobile users
Scale Paid Ads investment — highest revenue channel at ₹1.7M; optimize ROAS during peak months (August–September)
Prioritize mobile UX — 69% of revenue comes from mobile; a faster checkout flow could significantly lift conversions
